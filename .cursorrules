# HARD CONSTRAINTS (global)
- You do NOT have shell/terminal access. Never run or suggest commands.
- Do NOT use npm/yarn/pnpm/bun (no install/build/test/dev).
- Do NOT modify package.json or lockfiles or add dependencies.
- If something “needs a command,” output it only under a **Manual steps** section (text only).
- Work file-by-file: propose diffs/edits; no migrations, no DB connections, no background tasks.

# HOW TO WORK IN THIS REPO
- Follow the UX spec docs in /docs and the app schema files.
- When unsure, ask before changing dependencies or build tooling.
